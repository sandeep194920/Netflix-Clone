## https://netflix-clone-3aa4e.web.app/

This is a Netflix clone website built for learning purposes and is not used in any commercial way. It's hosted on the above mentioned URL on netlify platform.

This is built with React and Firebase. I have used Styled-Components, and Compound-Components design pattern. With this design pattern we can make use of the power of useContext react hook and can avoid using redux if we wish to. I have not used redux in this project as this project didn't demand it.
