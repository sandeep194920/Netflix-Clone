This is a Netflix clone website built for learning purposes and is not used in any commercial way. It's hosted on the above mentioned website.

This is built with React and Firebase. I have used Styled-Components, and Compound-Components design pattern. With this design pattern we can make use of the power of useContext react hook and can avoid using redux if we wish to. I have not used redux in this project as this project didn't demand it.

I was inspired by Karl Hadwen who has done a video on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_EEwGe-a9o&t=28830s&ab_channel=KarlHadwen
